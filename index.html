    <p1>Do you think that there's a way<br>
        that I could see your pretty face?<br>
        Cause it's been a little while<br>
        and I am missing you today<br>
        Courtney Rae<br><br>I wanna kiss your forehead while you sleep<br>when you get home I could rub your feet<br>if you had a long day<br>My darlin' Courtney Rae
        <br><br>Put your little hand in mine<br>
        my shadow, my partner in crime<br>
        and please don't let it go, no not today<br>
        Courtney Rae<br><br>
        I can't take no more goodbyes<br>
        it's getting harder every time<br>
        to have to watch you walk away<br>
        Courtney Rae<br>
        Turn around and come back to me<br>
        and we'll do anything that we please<br>
        and I won't spend another day<br>
        without my Courtney Rae
    </p1>
